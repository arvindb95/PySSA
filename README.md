# PySSA  
Python implementation of the Sychrotron Self Absorbed (SSA) model from
[Soderberg et al. 2005](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...621..908S/abstract) 

## To do
- Try using precalculated functions F2 and F3, and iterpolating to required values instead of integrating from scratch everytime (to improve run time of MCMC code)
- Make README more user friendly
- Add list of dependancies
