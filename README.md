# PySSA  
Python implementation of the Sychrotron Self Absorbed (SSA) model from
[Soderberg et al. 2005](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...621..908S/abstract)

## Usage 
- Use `PySSA.py` to generate an SSA lightcurve for your choice of parameters. 
- Script `SSA_MCMC_fit.py` can be used to run an MCMC fit to get best fit SSA model for your dataset
- To make pretty plots of the MCMC chains, correlation plots etc..., use `plotter.py`

## To do
- Method to choose only required number of parameters and set others to constant
- Make README more user friendly
- Add list of dependancies
